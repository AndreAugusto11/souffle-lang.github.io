A component is a modular part in a program that may encapsulate component elements 
including relation declarations, type declarations, rules, facts, directives, and other components. 
A component has component declarations and a component instantiations.

A component declaration starts with the keyword `.comp` followed by the name of the component an a block between `{` and `}`
containing the component elements of the component. 

For example, 
```
.comp MyComponent {
    .type myType = number
    .decl TheAnswer(x:myType)    // component relation
    TheAnswer(42).               // component fact
}
```
declares a new component with the name `MyComponent`. The component elements are a type `myType`, 
a relation `TheAnswer` and a fact. 

We instantiate a component using the `.init` keyword followed by a unique name of the instance, 
the `=` symbol, and the name of the component declaration. 

In this example,
```
.init myCompInstance1 = MyComponent
.decl Test(x:number)
Test(x) :- myCompInstance1.TheAnswer(x).
```
we instantiate the component `MyComponent` with the name `myCompInstance1` and the name `myCompInstance2`. 
Internally, Souffle flattens the component instantiation
creating for each component its own namespace. The names of the component elements
are extended using the instantiation name as a prefix. 

For the above example, Souffle internally expands the component instantiation as follows:
```
.type myCompInstance1.myType = number
.decl myCompInstance1.TheAnswer(x:myType)    // MyComponent relation for instance myCompInstance1
myCompInstance1.TheAnswer(42).               // MyComponent fact for instance myCompInstance1
.decl Test(x:number)
Test(x) :- myCompInstance1.TheAnswer(x).
```

In this example, we have two component instantiation of `MyComponent`:
```
.init myCompInstance1 = MyComponent
.init myCompInstance2 = MyComponent
myCompInstance2.TheAnswer(33).

.decl Test(x:number)
Test(x) :- myCompInstance2.TheAnswer(x). // output: 42, 33
```
producing internally the following logic program: 
```
.type myCompInstance1.myType = number
.decl myCompInstance1.TheAnswer(x:myType)    // MyComponent relation for instance myCompInstance1
myCompInstance1.TheAnswer(42).               // MyComponent fact for instance myCompInstance1
.type myCompInstance2.myType = number
.decl myCompInstance2.TheAnswer(x:myType)    // MyComponent relation for instance myCompInstance1
myCompInstance2.TheAnswer(42).               // MyComponent fact for instance myCompInstance1
.decl Test(x:number)
Test(x) :- myCompInstance1.TheAnswer(x).
```

In the following example, the component defines two relations and rules, where the input is provided outside the component:
```
.comp Reachability {
    .decl edge(u:number,v:number)
    .decl reach(u:number,v:number)
    reach(u,v) :- edge(u,v).
    reach(u,v) :- reach(u,x), edge(x,v).
}

.init r = Reachability
r.edge(1, 2).
r.edge(2, 3).
r.edge(2, 4).
```

## Inheritance
One component can inherit from another. Inheritance in this case is purely
injection of rules from the base component into its subcomponent. The syntax is as follows:

```
.comp Base {
    .decl TheAnswer(x:number)
    TheAnswer(42).
}

.comp Child : Base {
    .decl WhatIsTheAnswer(n:number)
    WhatIsTheAnswer(n) :- TheAnswer(n).
}
```


## Type Parametrization
Components can be parametrized with types (including records) or other components in similar fashion
as generics in Java or templates in C++.

```
.comp Graph<TNode> {
    .decl edge(u:TNode, v:TNode)
    // ...
}
```

If the parameter is meant to be another component, it can be instantiated:

```
.comp Reachability<TGraph> {
    .init graph = TGraph
    // ...
    reach(u, v) :- graph.edge(u, v).
}
```

When initializing parametrized component, we must provide actual parameters:

```
.init g = Graph<number>
.init reach = Reachability<MyGraph>
```

Note that the following is not possible:

```
.init reach = Reachability<Graph<number>>
```

This limitation can be overcome with inheritance:

```
.comp NumberGraph : Graph<number> {}
.init reach = Reachability<NumberGraph>
```

Note that instantiation of `TGraph` inside `Reachability`
will create new copies of `TGraph` relations (specifically relations
of whatever is used as actual parameter for `TGraph`).

## Type Parametrization and Inheritance
Type parameters can passed around when inheriting. Example:

```
.comp A<T> { .... }
.comp B<K> : A<K> { ... }
```

Although it is not recommended, the type parameter can be used as the base class:

```
.comp A<T> : T { ... }
```

## Overridable Relations
If a relation, declared in a super component is overridable, it would be possible to override its associated rules in the sub-component while inheriting the rest of the relations from the super-component.
A relation in a sub-component with the same signature as a relation in the super component can override the super component's relation if it has `overridable` keyword.

```
.comp A {
    .decl Rel(x:number) overridable
    Rel(1).
}
```
Since relation `Rel(x:number)` in the component `A` has `overridable` keyword, any sub-component of `A` can override this relation using `.override` keyword.

```
.comp B : A {
    .override Rel
    Rel(2).
}
```
The override semantic replaces the clauses of all super-components by clauses of the sub-component. We omit the actual relation declaration in the sub-component because changing the signature of the relation would cause serious havoc with the use of the relation outside the scope of the sub-component.

As another example, we can use override semantics to implement a more precise version of an existing analysis by overriding some relations:

```
.comp AbstractPointsto{
    .decl HeapAllocationMerge(heap,mergeHeap) overridable
    HeapAllocationMerge(heap,"<<string-constant>>") :-
        StringConstant(heap).
    // ...
}

.comp PrecisePointsto : AbstractPointsto{
    .override HeapAllocationMerge
    HeapAllocationMerge(heap,"<<string-constant>>") :-
        StringConstant(heap),
        !ClassNameStringConstant(heap),
        !SimpleNameStringConstant(heap).
}

.init precise_pointsto = PrecisePointsto
```
In this example, PrecisePointsto inherits all the relations from AbstractPointsto, but only implements the HeapAllocationMerge relation differently. This feature avoids code duplications when we need several implementations of a generic analysis with small variations.


## Syntax 
In the following, we define the component model more formally using [syntax diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_diagram) and [EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backusâ€“Naur_form). The syntax diagrams were produced with [Bottlecaps](https://www.bottlecaps.de/rr/ui).

### Component Declaration
A component declaration may consist of [type declarations](types), [relation declarations](relations), [rules](rules), [facts](facts), [directives](directives), override directives, [component declarations and initialisations](components).

![Component Declaration](https://souffle-lang.github.io/img/component_decl.svg)

```ebnf
component_decl ::= 
  '.comp' component_type ( ( ':' | ',' ) component_type )* 
    '{' 
        ( type_decl | relation_decl | rule | fact | directive | '.override' IDENT | component_init | component_decl )* 
    '}'
```

### Component Initialisation
A component initialisation has a name and the component declaration name with its parameters.  

![Component Initialisation](https://souffle-lang.github.io/img/component_init.svg)

```ebnf
component_init ::= '.init' IDENT '=' component_type
```

### Component Type

A component type is a signature of a component either used for initialisation, super-component references, or declaration of a component.

![Component Type](https://souffle-lang.github.io/img/component_type.svg)

```ebnf
component_type ::= IDENT ( '<' IDENT ( ',' IDENT )* '>' )?
```
