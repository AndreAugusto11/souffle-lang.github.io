There is a cornucopia of Datalog systems for a wide range of applications:
 
 * [ABCDatalog](http://abcdatalog.seas.harvard.edu)
 * [bddbddb](http://bddbddb.sourceforge.net): based on BDDs, single core execution, designed for static program analysis. 
 * [Coral](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/coral/): developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison
 * [IRIS](http://repo.roscidus.com/java/iris): semantic extensions to Datalog, top&bottom-up.
 * [LogicBlox](http://www.logicblox.com/): based on advanced trie data-structures, commercial. 
 * [muZ in Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/wiki)
 * [SociaLite](http://socialite-lang.github.io): based on map/reduce, distributed computing

If we missed your Datalog engine, please let us know and/or add it to this page.
