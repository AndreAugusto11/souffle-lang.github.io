Prior to Soufflé, preliminary work on Datalog translation for static program analysis commenced in the Oracle Labs/Brisbane in December 2013. A source-to-source translator from Datalog to SQL was developed. This pilot project was lead and developed by [Bernhard Scholz](http://www.it.usyd.edu.au/~scholz) (a visiting professor from The University of Sydney) with Kostyantyn Voroboyov (a research assistant/intern from Bond University). For the source-to-source translator valuable input was given by Till Westmann (a software architect in the Oracle Labs at that time). The findings of the source-to-source translator were published in:

 * `Bernhard Scholz, Kostyantyn Vorobyov, Padmanabhan Krishnan, Till Westmann: A Datalog Source-to-Source Translator for Static Program Analysis: An Experience Report. ASWEC 2015: 28-37`

After completion of the pilot project, Soufflé commenced in 2014. The project was lead and developed by Bernhard Scholz with Paul Subotic (a research assistant/intern from University College London), Herbert Jordan (a research assistant/intern from the University of Innsbruck), and Raihaan Amod (a visiting student from the University of Queensland). Support was received from Alex Jordan (Oracle Labs) to develop an object-oriented interface for C++ programs and Nicholas Allen (Oracle Labs), who refactored the front-end of the Soufflé compiler in late 2015. Numerous input was received by the users of Soufflé including Behnaz Hassanshahi (a research assistant/intern from the National University of Singapore), Stepan Sindelar (a research assistant/intern from the Charles University in Prague), Raghavendra K. Ramesh (Oracle Labs), Francois Gauthier (Oracle Labs), Yi Lu (Oracle Labs), and Paddy Krishnan (Oracle Labs).
