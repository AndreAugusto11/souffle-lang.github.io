Souffle supports provenance to explain how tuples were computed in Souffle programs.

#### Souffle command line option
The souffle command line option is `-t`
- Use `-t0` for provenance transformer without any explain interface
- Use `-t1` for provenance with ncurses explain
- Use `-t2` for provenance with stdout explain

#### Explain interface
Once in the explain interface, the commands are:
- `explain relation(<arg1>, <arg2>, ...)` prints the derivation tree for the given tuple
- `subproof relation(<label>)` prints the partial derivation tree for the tuple given by label (this may be generated by explain if the depth limit is reached)
- `rule relation <rulenum>` prints the rule corresponding to rulenum. These numbers are printed as labels for each level in the derivation tree.
- `setdepth <depth>` sets the maximum height of derivation trees printed. If a derivation tree is higher than this height, then a subproof label will be printed instead of the full proof
- `exit` exits the interface
