This is the tool paper about Souffle. It was published in CAV'16.

** Abstract **
Soufflé is an open source programming framework that performs static program analysis expressed in Datalog on very large code bases, including points-to analysis on OpenJDK7 (1.4M program variables, 350K objects, 160K methods) in under a minute. Soufflé is being successfully used for Java security analyses at Oracle Labs due to (1) its high-performance, (2) support for rapid program analysis development, and (3) customizability. Soufflé incorporates the highly flexible Datalog-based program analysis paradigm while exhibiting performance results that are on-par with manually developed state-of-the-art tools. In this tool paper, we introduce the Soufflé architecture, usage and demonstrate its applicability for large-scale code analysis on the OpenJDK7 library as a use case.
