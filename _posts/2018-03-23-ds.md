Jonathan Chung has extended Soufflé to utilize various data-structures. Souffle supports different default-structures including hash-table, red-black trees (STL), HTM for B-Trees, etc.  Jonathan present his finding on data-structures in Souffle at the University of Sydney's *Programming Languages and Compiler* research group meeting. Slides for the talk can be found [here](/pdf/datastructure.pdf).
