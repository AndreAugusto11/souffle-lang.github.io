Oracle Labs made  Soufflé open-source on the 8th of March, 2016. 
Soufflé is a Datalog-like language that compiles programs to efficient parallel C++ code. Currently, Soufflé is used as a domain-specific language for static program analysis, over large code bases with millions of lines of code. 

## Features of Soufflé

* Efficient translation to parallel C++ of Datalog programs
* Extended semantics of Safe Datalog, e.g., permitting unbounded recursions with numbers
* Simple component model for Datalog specifications
* Recursively defined record types for tuples
* Static type system for attributes
