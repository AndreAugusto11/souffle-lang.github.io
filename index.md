Soufflé is a translator of declarative Datalog programs into the C++ language. Soufflé is used as a domain-specific language for static program analysis, over large code bases with millions of lines of code. Soufflé aims at producing high-performance C++ code that can be compiled with the native compiler on the target machine.

## Features of Soufflé 

 * Efficient translation to parallel C++ of Datalog programs
 * Extended semantics of Safe Datalog, e.g., permitting unbounded recursions with numbers
 * Simple component model for Datalog specifications
 * Recursively defined record types for tuples
 * Static type system for attributes
